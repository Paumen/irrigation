# Simulator state model

The **single authoritative model** for **controls**, **state**, **readings**, and **faults** in the
irrigation simulator — the engine vocabulary. Other docs reference it and must not restate these
decisions: `sim_spec.md` owns the requirements, `sim_ui.md` the UX, `sim_build_plan.md` the plan.
Written from the domain; the migration map at the end says what each existing symbol becomes.

## Status — built vs. to-build

This is a target spec, not a description of today's code. Honest about the gap:

- **Now (this phase): a clean, healthy system.** Get `live`/`pressure`/`flow` and the
  readings right for a correctly functioning system, and author the finer-grained topology
  the model needs (valve internals, controller output ports).
- **Later: faults.** The three fault verbs are the *design intent*, not yet implemented.
  `system.yaml` currently has **no `fail:` entries** and `compileFaults` is a stub. The rule
  for this phase is: **don't build anything that makes faults hard to add later** — every
  conductance and passage must be a real, named element a fault verb can target.

## The core distinction

Every value in the simulator is exactly one of these, and never two:

- **Control** — an *input* you set (operator hardware, controller output). Depends on nothing.
- **State** — a component's physical condition, *computed* by the solvers from controls + topology.
- **Reading** — a *named view* derived from state, computed on demand, **never stored**.
- **Fault** *(later)* — an injected *modifier* on a component's transfer behaviour.

The test for any value: *"Can I set this directly, right now, with nothing else being true?"*
Yes → control. No → it is a state, a reading, or (later) a fault effect.

## State — three primitives, full stop

A component carries at most three state values:

| primitive | domain | meaning | type |
|---|---|---|---|
| `live` | electrical | electricity reaches it | bool |
| `pressure` | hydraulic | water potential present | number (absent = dry) |
| `flow` | hydraulic | water moving through / out of it | number |

That is the entire state vocabulary. Not energized/powered/reaching. Not
wet/charged/connected/pressurised/watering. **`live`, `pressure`, `flow`.**

`pressure` and `flow` are independent: a dead-headed branch has `pressure` with
`flow` ≈ 0; a freely venting line has `flow` with low `pressure`.

### Which primitive a component carries

Decided by the component's **role** (from the topology), never authored per instance:

- electrical components (wires, controller, relay, coils, sockets, pump supply) → `live`
- hydraulic components (source, pipes, joints, valves, chambers, heads) → `pressure` + `flow`

The internals of a component are themselves components and follow the same rule:
a solenoid coil carries `live`; the bonnet chamber and metering port carry `pressure`/`flow`.
They get the *same three words*, never a private dialect.

## Controls — the complete input surface

A control exists only where there is an actuator a hand or the controller can move:

```
controls = {
  energize{port},                   // controller output terminals (the only electrical control)
  handle{valve},                    // manual isolation valve
  throttle{valve},                  // flow-control screw, 0..1 (1 = factory-open)
  bonnetBleed{valve},               // bonnet bleed screw
  solenoidBleed{valve},             // solenoid manual bleed (distinct actuator)
  headShutoff{head},                // per-head flo-stop
  nozzle{head}, arc{head},          // head configuration
}
```

The controller has no "zone" or "pump" concept. It **energizes a port**; whether that
port lifts a zone valve or trips the pump relay is decided entirely by the **wiring**.
"Pump" and "zone" are roles the topology assigns, not control vocabulary.

> **To-build (granular graph):** the controller is authored today with a flat `to:` and no
> per-port terminals — per-zone routing lives on the cable. `energize{port}` needs those
> output ports authored as real nodes in the electrical graph.

## Boundaries — state fixed by the world

Three states sit at the edges of the system and are given, not propagated:

- **well** `pressure` — water available at the source (present = wet, absent = dry)
- **socket** `live` — mains present at the supply
- **pump priming chamber** `pressure` — water held in the pump body (you prime it once)

A boundary is just a state whose rule is "the world says so" instead of "look upstream."
There is no separate *environment* category and no `mains` noun.

## Readings — derived views, never stored

Pure functions of the three primitives, computed when asked. The human-readable
diagnostic layer lives here, not in stored state. Each one *adds* something to the raw
primitive (a threshold, a location, a domain term) — none is a bare restatement:

| reading | definition |
|---|---|
| `open(valve)` | the valve passes `flow` |
| `pressurised(id)` | `pressure` ≥ working threshold |
| `primed(pump)` | pump-inlet `pressure` present |
| `watering(head)` | head `flow` > 0 |
| `starved(head)` | `pressure` present but `flow` ≈ 0 |

There is **no `commandedNotReaching` reading.** A coil is `live` or `dead`, full stop — if
you energize a port and the coil reads `dead`, that *is* the answer. "Commanded but not
reaching" is not a thing the model names; comparing a control to a primitive is an ad-hoc
question, not a stored or named status. (Likewise no `reaching` reading — "is it fed" is
just `pressure` present / `live`.)

## How state is produced — two scales of hydraulics

- **`live`** comes from the **electrical solve** (continuity from live sockets through closed
  contacts and energized coils — a reachability walk over the wiring).
- **`pressure` / `flow`** come from the **hydraulic solve**, which has two cleanly separated scales:

  1. **The delivery network → EPANET.** The mains, pipes, valves, and heads — the global,
     coupled flow problem EPANET exists for. Unchanged from today. It produces each valve's
     **inlet and outlet pressure**.
  2. **Each valve's actuation circuit → a local relation, *not* EPANET.** The metering port,
     bonnet chamber, pilot seat and bleed port are a tiny pressure-actuation circuit that is
     **local to the valve** — both its endpoints are the valve's own inlet and outlet, which
     EPANET already solved. Chamber pressure is a small resistor-divider between those two
     known pressures over the port conductances. It is computed directly, with no global
     matrix. (EPANET *could* represent it, but it is poorly suited: orifice-scale conductances
     next to the mains make a stiff, convergence-fragile system, and a sealed chamber is a
     zero-flow dead-end — EPANET's weak spots — for zero benefit, since the boundary pressures
     are already known.)

The two couple through the diaphragm, evaluated each pass of the **existing fixed-point valve
loop**: the valve opens when the pilot is **venting** — the vent conductance beats the metering
conductance (`rVent < rMeter`), so the chamber drains toward the outlet side — gated by the
inlet lift/stay hysteresis the loop already applies. The conductance test (rather than a raw
`inlet − chamber` pressure subtraction) is what keeps the decision stable when the valve is shut
and its outlet pressure is undefined; it captures both the pilot opening *and* a clogged metering
port (`rMeter` rises → still vented → stuck open). `chamberBar` is the resulting diagnostic
pressure. The comparison sets the valve's EPANET status for the next pass.

There is **one truth: the solve.** No qualitative rule engine runs alongside it — the local
valve relation is *physics* (a pressure divider over real conductances producing real
`pressure`/`flow`), not the symbolic rules of the old `states.js`.

### Validation

Deleting `states.js` removes its internal cross-check (today's ~83 reconciliations). With one
truth there is nothing to reconcile, but the regression net must be replaced, not just lost:
the rewritten harness asserts the **solved primitives and readings** against hand-checked
scenarios (idle, one zone running, a cut controller feed, a shared-return break, …) — the
same scenarios as today, asserting on `live`/`pressure`/`flow` and the readings directly
instead of on a qualitative projection.

## Worked example — the solenoid valve, including a clogged metering port

The valve's internals are real components, each carrying only the three primitives:

| internal part | primitive | how set |
|---|---|---|
| coil | `live` | electrical solve |
| bonnet chamber | `pressure` | **local relation** (divider between inlet & outlet) |
| metering port | `flow` | **local relation** (`(inlet − chamber) / R_meter`) |
| pilot seat / bleed port | `flow` | **local relation** (vent path when open) |

The mechanism *is* physics — *no `up`/`down`/`open`/`closed` states, no rule engine*:

- the valve passes flow ⟸ the pilot vents (`(coil live OR solenoidBleed OR bonnetBleed) AND throttle > 0` ⟹ `rVent < rMeter`) **AND** the inlet clears the lift/stay hysteresis
- diaphragm position is a **reading** of (inlet `pressure` vs chamber `pressure`)

**Metering port clogged** *(a later-phase fault)* = `clog(meteringPort)` — raise `R_meter`,
the same verb as a clogged pipe:

```
clog metering port → chamber can't refill → chamber pressure stays low
→ diaphragm stays lifted → valve passes flow even de-energized → stuck open / weeping
```

Every step is one of the three primitives; the fault is one parameter on one real,
named conductance; the diagnosis is tracing that chain. This is *why* the metering port,
chamber and ports must be authored as real elements now even though faults come later — so
the verb has something to target.

## Faults — three verbs (design intent, later phase)

A fault never invents a new state. It touches one of three things:

| verb | effect | examples |
|---|---|---|
| `dead(id)` | force `live = false` | pump motor failed, wire cut, coil open |
| `clog(id)` / `leak(id)` | change a component's hydraulic conductance | blocked nozzle, clogged metering port, pipe leak, weak pump |
| `stuck(id, open\|closed)` | force a passage's actuation | valve seized open, diaphragm jammed |

Every passage has a conductance, so any unexpected fault has a home without new vocabulary.
**Not implemented this phase** — see Status. The healthy-system work must keep every
conductance and passage a real, named element so these verbs drop in later without rework.

## Migration map — what each existing symbol becomes

Legend: KILL (gone) · BECOMES (re-homed) · KEEP (engine/physics, not state-vocab).

### Controls (current input fields)
- `manualOpen` BECOMES `handle{}` · `bleedOpen` BECOMES `bonnetBleed{}` · `solenoidBleed`/`throttle`/`nozzle`/`arc` KEEP · `floStop` BECOMES `headShutoff{}`
- `pumpStart`/`mv`, `zones` KILL → `energize{port}` (role moves into the wiring; controller ports to be authored)
- `gridPower`/`adapterPower` KILL → boundary `live`; `env.wellWet`/`env.primingChamberWet` KILL → boundary `pressure`

### Qualitative states (`states.js` + ~32 `system.yaml` `states:` blocks) — this whole layer dies
- `live/dead` BECOMES primitive `live`
- `wet/dry` BECOMES reading (`pressure` present)
- `pressurised`, `primed`, `open/closed`, `up/down`, `watering/off` KILL → readings
- `COMPLEMENT`, `POSITIVE`, `parseKindStates`, `axisOf`, `isGroupDef`, `hasRule`,
  `buildStateResolver`, `validateStateResolver`, `computeStates`, `groundedPos`,
  `CROSSCHECK_KEYS` — **`states.js` deleted in full** (cross-check coverage moves to the
  scenario harness, see Validation)

### Solve outputs ("states in disguise")
- `pressureBar`/`headM` BECOMES `pressure`; `demands`/`flow`/`pumpFlow` BECOMES `flow`
- `controllerEnergised`/`relayCoil`/`pumpPowered`/`zoneEnergised`/`socketLive`/`energisedWires` BECOMES `live` (one word, per component)
- `pumpOn`, `valveOpen`, `watering` KILL → readings
- `commandedNotOpening`/`commandedNotEnergised`/`pumpCommandedNotPowered` KILL → no replacement (a coil is just `dead`)
- `reachable` KEEP (engine: the hydraulic propagation)
- `converged`/`iters`/`valvesFrozen`/`dmp`/`stable`/`prevP`/`valveInlet` KEEP (solver bookkeeping)
- `throws`/`precip` KEEP (readings from the head transfer law); `outSum`/`massImbalance` KEEP (diagnostics over `flow`)

### Faults (`faults.js`) — later phase
- `pumpDisabled`, `valveDisabled`, `elecBlocked` BECOMES `dead(id)`
- `closedLinks`, `linkK`, `valveLossScale`, `pumpHeadScale`, `leaks`, `outletMods.flowScale/zeroFlow` BECOMES `clog`/`leak`
- `valveForcedOpen`, `bleedForcedOpen` BECOMES `stuck(open)`; `outletMods.nozzle/arc` BECOMES an `nozzle`/`arc` control value
- `emptyEffects()`/`compileFaults()` stay stubs this phase; `system.yaml` `fail:` entries to be authored later

### Engine / topology (core reused — finer-grained, with a new local valve relation)
- `solveElectrical` + `buildAdj`/`bfs`/`pathOf`/`reachable`/`throughBoth` KEEP (the `live` engine)
- `solveSteady`/`computeReachable`/`finalize` KEEP (EPANET delivery solve); the fixed-point
  valve loop decides open/closed from the vent-vs-metering conductance (`rVent < rMeter`) plus the inlet lift/stay hysteresis
- **new** valve-actuation relation — per-valve local chamber-pressure / port-flow computation,
  fed by EPANET's inlet/outlet pressures (NOT added to the EPANET network)
- `buildTopology` EXTENDED — author valve internals and controller ports as real components;
  internals feed the local relation, they are **not** spliced into the EPANET matrix
- `outlets.js` (catalog transfer laws + nozzle/arc application), `model.js`
  (roles decide which primitive a component carries), `inp.js`, `epanet-runner.js`, `units.js` KEEP
- **new** `readings.js` — `open`, `pressurised`, `primed`, `watering`, `starved`

### Config constants
All KEEP, re-homed: unit/physics (`M_PER_BAR`, `G`); solver tuning (`ALPHA*`, `*_TOL*`,
`MAX_ITERS`, `EPANET_*`, `VALVE_FREEZE_TAIL`); transfer params (`VALVE_OPEN_BAR`/`STAY_BAR`,
`SPRAY_CLAMP_BAR`, geometry, `THROTTLE_MIN`, `PRESSURISED_BAR`); fault params (`CLOG_*`,
`PILOT_CLOG_BLOCKS`, `PUMP_CLOG_LOSS`, `*_BORE_MM`, `*_CD`, `WRONG_STREAM_BORE_SCALE`)
— the last group sits idle until the fault phase.
