# F-Code Specification

**Version:** 1.0 
**Status:** canonical
**Format:** dotted (`F<component>.<mode>.<instance>`)
**Source of truth for migration:** the live `data.json` cause taxonomy

---

## 1. Grammar

```
F <component> . <mode> . <instance>
```

- **Component digit** = *location along the system*.
- **Mode digit** = *physicality* (physical low, logical high).
- **Instance** = specific case; omitted when a mode has one case.

### Component digits

| Digit | Component | Layer |
|:-----:|-----------|-------|
| `1` | App | command (remote) |
| `2` | Controller | command (box) |
| `3` | Wiring (24 V) | electrical distribution |
| `4` | Relay | electrical switching |
| `5` | Pump | water path → |
| `6` | Main hose (32 mm) | |
| `7` | Zone valves | |
| `8` | Zone hose (25 mm) | |
| `9` | Heads | → end of flow |

`F1–F4` are the command/electrical layer; `F5–F9` are the water path in flow order —
with one deliberate seam: `F7` (the zone valves) is the only component spanning both
layers, carrying electrical faults (solenoid coil, plunger) alongside hydraulic ones
(diaphragm, seat, body). The §2 F7 note covers the test that resolves which side is at
fault.

### Mode digits (physical → logical gradient; 8 off-axis)

| Digit | Mode | Meaning |
|:-----:|------|---------|
| `1` | **Physical defect** | Intrinsic physical fault of the part |
| `3` | **Physical obstruction** | Flow blocked or lost (air / debris) |
| `4` | **Install error** | Physical setup fault |
| `5` | **Software error** | Code-level fault (app bug, firmware) |
| `6` | **Settings error** | Logical config in software |
| `8` | **External fault** | Cause outside the component's boundary |

Digits `1–6` form the physical→logical gradient; digit `8` (external) sits off this
axis, marking a cause beyond the component's own boundary.

**Reserved component digits:** `0`. **Reserved mode digits:** `0, 2, 7, 9`.

```

**Note (F1 vs F2) — remote channel vs. the box.** Both surfaces can run or change the
system: the app reaches the controller over wifi/cloud (`F1`), and the controller acts
directly via its touchscreen and stored schedule (`F2`). They are *not* peers — `F2`
owns command and execution; `F1` is only the remote path layered on top. So the
touchscreen lives in `F2.1` (controller hardware) and the watering schedule / zone map
lives in `F2.6` (controller state), **not** in `F1`. `F1` covers only the app itself
(`F1.5`) and its connection (`F1.8`); kill the wifi and the app path dies while the
touchscreen and stored schedule keep running.

**Note (F7) — resolving the electrical-vs-hydraulic fork.** As noted in §1, the valve
straddles both layers: its solenoid is **electrical** (24 V from the controller — coil
faults at `F7.1.1`, plunger/port obstruction at `F7.3.1`), while the diaphragm, seat,
and body are **hydraulic** (`F7.1.2`, `F7.1.3`, `F7.3.2`). The isolating test is
**manual operation**: open the bleed screw or turn the solenoid by hand. If the zone
then runs, the hydraulics are sound and the fault is electrical — solenoid coil, wiring
(`F3`), or controller (`F2`). If it still won't run, the fault is hydraulic — diaphragm,
seat, or obstruction. This is why an `F7` symptom on its own does not tell you which
neighbour to suspect; the bleed test resolves the fork before any part is replaced.

**Note (F7) — Teflon paste-and-tape.** Using both over-torques the joint and splits the
valve body: an install act with a defect outcome. Score it as `F7.1.3`, not as an `F7.4`
instance, to avoid double-counting.

**Forward-looking codes (no historical cause, absent from migration):**
`F3.4`, `F4.4`, `F5.8`. (`F2.8` is sourced from the R22 split.)

**Stale code (images.yaml only, never in `data.json`):** `R93` — used in
`.claude/skills/irrigation-troubleshoot/images.yaml` for arc/range/nozzle rotor
images. Resolves to **`F9.4`** in the new taxonomy. Rekey at migration time.

---

## 3. Migration table (live `data.json` → F)

**Six 1→2 splits** (⮌ = one live code maps to two F-codes). Parent broadcasts:
`R1→F1, R2→F2, R3→F4, R4→F5, R5→F6, R6→F3, R7→F7, R8→F8, R9→F9`.

| Live | → F | Kind |
|------|-----|------|
| R11 | F2.6 | move (cross-family) |
| R12 | F1.5 | rename |
| R13 | F1.8 | rename |
| R22 | **F2.1 + F2.8** | ⮌ split |
| R23 | **F2.5 + F2.6** | ⮌ split |
| R31 | F4.1 | move |
| R41 | F5.3 | move |
| R42 | F5.1 | move |
| R51 | F6.1 | move |
| R52 | F6.3 | move |
| R61 | F3.1.1 | move |
| R62 | F3.1.2 | move |
| R63 | F3.1.3 | move |
| R71 | **F7.1.1 + F7.3.1** | ⮌ split |
| R72 | **F7.1.2 + F7.3.2** | ⮌ split |
| R73 | F7.1.3 | rename |
| R74 | F7.4 | rename (mode-level) |
| R81 | F8.1 | rename |
| R82 | F8.3 | rename |
| R91 | **F9.1.1 + F9.3** | ⮌ split |
| R92 | **F9.1.2 + F9.4** | ⮌ split |

`R11` (schedule / zone map) now moves to the **existing** `F2.6` rather than the old
`F1.6` — schedule is controller state, not an app concern (§2 note). `F2.6` therefore
aggregates `R11` (straight move) plus the `R23` settings share. The old `F1.6` no longer
exists.

**Parent linkage in `data.json`.** Every F-code cause row carries
`parent: 'F<component>'` — flat at the component level — regardless of whether the
code itself is at mode level (e.g., `F7.4`) or instance level (e.g., `F7.1.1`). The
mode digit is structural in the F-code *name* but not in the parent chain: no
intermediate `F7.1` / `F7.3` / `F7.4` cause rows exist. This keeps the existing
engine's flat `parent`-field broadcast logic unchanged — `F7:x` lifts every cause
with `parent: 'F7'` (all F7.1.x, F7.3.x leaves plus the mode-level `F7.4` row).
Mode-level broadcasts (e.g., `F7.1:x` to all valve defects) are **not** supported by
this convention; if ever needed, add them as additional explicit effects rather than
as broadcasts.

String = rename/move. Array = 1→many split (manual apportioning required, §5).

## 5. Split apportioning (required before data.json migration)

Each split source's `baseline` and every per-question `effects` entry divides between
its two targets.

**Baseline apportioning.** Naive duplication doubles the prior. Suggested defaults
(tune as needed):

| Source | `baseline` | → first | → second |
|---|---|---|---|
| R22 (1.2) | F2.1 0.8 | F2.8 0.4 | unit defects more common than socket-side power |
| R23 (1.2) | F2.5 0.6 | F2.6 0.6 | firmware ≈ settings a priori |
| R71 (1.0) | F7.1.1 0.5 | F7.3.1 0.5 | coil ≈ plunger a priori |
| R72 (1.2) | F7.1.2 0.7 | F7.3.2 0.5 | diaphragm tears more common than metering-port debris |
| R91 (1.2) | F9.1.1 0.6 | F9.3 0.6 | regulator ≈ debris a priori |
| R92 (1.2) | F9.1.2 0.4 | F9.4 0.8 | arc/range mis-set more common than gear-drive seized |

### R22 → F2.1 (unit defect) + F2.8 (socket-side power)
Hits: Q3 (1.0), Q9 ctrl row, Q10b ctrl (1.0), Q11 storm (1.0), Q13 (1.6), Q20 (−0.2).
Q11 storm → F2.8; Q13 "0 V" → F2.1; Q3 "silent" → both.

### R23 → F2.5 (firmware) + F2.6 (settings)
Hits: Q2 (−0.2), Q2q (0.4), Q7 (1.0), Q9 ctrl row, Q11b outage (1.0), Q20 (0.4).
Q7 "restart fixed it" → F2.5; Q11b outage → lean F2.5.
(`F2.6` also absorbs `R11`'s schedule effects as a straight move — no apportioning
needed for that portion; just sum it into the `F2.6` baseline/effects.)

### R71 → F7.1.1 (coil) + F7.3.1 (plunger / port obstruction)
Hits: Q2, Q2q, Q6, Q12, Q13, Q15, Q22.
Q15 coil-resistance → F7.1.1; Q6 "buzz or hum" → F7.3.1; Q12 "bleed runs" → both
(per the §2 F7 bleed-test note, electrical fault = coil or plunger).

### R72 → F7.1.2 (diaphragm tear) + F7.3.2 (metering port / screen debris)
Hits: Q10 valves row, Q12, Q17, Q18.
Q17 "damage or debris" → both (the option label conflates them; split 0.6 / 0.4).

### R91 → F9.1.1 (regulator) + F9.3 (debris/nozzle)
Hits: Q2q (0.6), Q8 gradual (0.4), Q10 rotor row (0.6). Split both.

### R92 → F9.1.2 (gear-drive stuck) + F9.4 (arc/range)
Hits: Q10 rotor row (1.0). Lean F9.4, small weight on F9.1.2.

(Parent `R9`→`F9` broadcasts hit all F9 children automatically.)

**Default rule if not hand-tuning:** duplicate each effect to both children, then trim.

## 5.5 Per-question recalibration

Effects in `data.json` that need adjustment beyond §5's default rule — cases where a
split-source effect should be **moved**, **dropped on one side**, or
**asymmetrically weighted** rather than duplicated. Anything not listed below
duplicates as-is.

### R22 → F2.1 (unit) + F2.8 (socket-side power)

| Question / option | Current R22 | F2.1 | F2.8 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q11 storm row | 1.0 | 0.2 | 1.0 |
| Q13 "0 V" | 1.6 | 1.6 | drop |
| Q20 "Clicks, 230 V out" | -0.2 | -0.2 | -0.4 |
| Q20 "Silent — no click" | 0.6 | 0.4 | 0.6 |
| Q10b ctrl row | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.4 |
| Q9 ctrl row (age) | — | yes | drop |

### R23 → F2.5 (firmware) + F2.6 (settings)

| Question / option | Current R23 | F2.5 | F2.6 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q7 "Restart fixed it" | 1.0 | 1.0 | drop |
| Q11b outage | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.2 |
| Q2q "Erratic" | 0.4 | 0.4 | 0.2 |
| Q2 "Several zones at once" | 0.4 | 0.2 | 0.4 |
| Q9 ctrl row (age) | — | 0.4 | drop |

### R71 → F7.1.1 (coil) + F7.3.1 (plunger / port obstruction)

| Question / option | Current R71 | F7.1.1 | F7.3.1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q6 "Buzz or hum" | 0.4 | drop | 0.4 |
| Q6 "Silent — no click" | 0.6 | 0.6 | 0.2 |
| Q13 "~24 VAC present" | 0.4 | 0.2 | 0.4 |
| Q15 "In range" | -1.0 | -1.0 | drop |
| Q15 "Open or infinite" | 1.6 | 1.6 | drop |
| Q15 "Near zero / very low" | 1.6 | 1.6 | drop |
| Q22 "water from valve" | 0.4 | drop | drop |

### R72 → F7.1.2 (diaphragm tear) + F7.3.2 (metering port / debris)

| Question / option | Current R72 | F7.1.2 | F7.3.2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q8 "Gradual" | 0.4 | 0.2 | 0.4 |
| Q17 "Damage or debris present" | 1.0 | 0.6 | 0.4 |
| Q18 "drips from heads when off" | 0.4 | 0.4 | 0.2 |

### R91 → F9.1.1 (regulator) + F9.3 (debris/nozzle)

| Question / option | Current R91 | F9.1.1 | F9.3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q2q "Erratic" | 0.6 | 0.2 | 0.6 |
| Q10 rotor row | 0.6 | 0.4 | 0.6 |
| Q9 rotor row (age) | — | yes | drop |

### R92 → F9.1.2 (gear-drive seized) + F9.4 (arc/range)

| Question / option | Current R92 | F9.1.2 | F9.4 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q10 rotor row | 1.0 | 0.2 | 1.0 |

### Parent-broadcast asymmetries

Cases where a parent-level broadcast (e.g., `R2:x` or `R7:x`) post-migration
would lift or suppress *all* children of the new component uniformly via the
flat `parent: 'F<component>'` link, but the symptom semantically targets only
a subset. Replace the broadcast with explicit per-child effects.

| Question / option | Current broadcast | Replace with |
|---|---|---|
| Q3 "Stays silent" | R2: 1.0 | F2.1: 1.0, F2.8: 1.0 (skip F2.5, F2.6 — firmware/settings don't silence the controller) |
| Q12 "Yes — zone runs" (bleed test) | R7: -1.4 | F7.1.2: -1.4, F7.1.3: -1.4, F7.3.2: -1.4, F7.4: -1.4 (skip F7.1.1, F7.3.1 — bleed-runs confirms hydraulics OK, so the electrical valve faults remain plausible per §2 F7 note) |

### Cross-family move (R11 → F2.6) — parent-broadcast compensation

The R11 move out of the R1 family means `F1` parent broadcasts no longer
reach F2.6. Where a question option carries **both** an `R1:x` and an `R2:y`
broadcast, the lost R1 signal is automatically restored via the `R2→F2`
broadcast (which now lifts F2.6 as an F2 child). Compensation is only needed
when `R1` broadcasts **solo**:

| Question / option | Current R1 broadcast | Compensating hit |
|---|---|---|
| Q2q "Normal and steady" | R1: 0.6 (no R2) | add explicit `F2.6: 0.6` |
| Q2q "Erratic" | R1: 0.4 (no R2) | add explicit `F2.6: 0.4` |

(Q1 "All 4 zones fail" `R1: 0.2 / R2: 0.2` and Q2 "No water anywhere"
`R1: 0.6 / R2: 0.6` both pair their R1 broadcasts with R2 broadcasts of equal
weight; the R2→F2 broadcast carries the lost share to F2.6 automatically — no
explicit hit needed there.)

### Downstream cleanup

- **Q9 ctrl row** `causes: ['R12', 'R22', 'R23']` → `['F2.1', 'F2.5']`. Drop
  F1.5 (app bugs aren't controller-age-correlated), drop F2.8 (socket/breaker
  don't age), drop F2.6 (stored settings don't age).

---

## 6. Parsing note

Strip `F`, then `code.slice(1).split('.')` → `[component, mode, instance]`.
Component digit `[0]` → §1 location table; mode digit `[1]` → §1 mode table.
Guard `length === 2` for mode-level codes.
